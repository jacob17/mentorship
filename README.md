# MentorShip

MentorShip is a front-end assignment that I did for AlphaCamp, a front-end development bootcamp.

MentorShip mimics an ADPList-style mentorship platform, where a list of fictional "mentors" from https://randomuser.me is called. Fictional job titles are randomly assigned to each mentor. I also used LocalStorage to store the randomly generated users, so the mentors would stay the same for every visit session. Users can save their favorite mentors to their profile, where they can also update their own name, picture and bio that is stored locally. Users can also search for mentors based on their preferences.
